Here is the list of project's I've been working on as a hobby:

## Swimming Race Pace Tracker - November 2019 - Present

Github Repository: (https://github.com/hhcarpenter12/my-swim-workout/)
Website: (https://hhcarpenter12.github.io/my-swim-workout/)

This is a swimming race pace tracker I wrote independently with Angular 7. Based on swimmers' best times, the app determines the target splits for an entered distance. Then, it converts them based on the pool configuration (short course yards, short course meters, long course meters). It also considers target splits for individual medley (butterfly, backstroke, breastroke, freestyle) events. Then, the swim coach can enter the number of repetitions, the amount of rest between each repetition, and the pace to hold within each repetition. Swim coaches can also import/export CSV files, so they can update personal bests and other information about the workout. I hope this would be a major time saver for swim coaches, especially for those who manage a large team, have to constantly switch back/forth from short course to long course, and have swimmers that do so many different events.
