## Welcome to Harry Carpenter's Github Page!

Here is the list of project's I've been working on as a hobby:

## Swimming Race Pace Tracker - November 2019 - Present

- Github Repository: (https://github.com/hhcarpenter12/my-swim-workout/)
- Website: (https://hhcarpenter12.github.io/my-swim-workout/)

This is a swimming workout app I wrote independently with Angular 7. The app includes a race pace tracker, an aerobic pacing tool, and a workout creator.

Based on your best time for your selected event, the race pace tracker determines the target split for an entered distance. Then, the app converts that target split based on the pool configuration (short course yards, short course meters, long course meters) in case the practice and competition pools have different configurations. The app also considers target splits for individual medley (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle) events. Then, you can enter the number of repetitions, the amount of rest between each repetition, and the pace to hold within each repetition. You can also import/export CSV files, so you can update personal bests and other information about the workout.

Based on your time trial time for your selected distance, the aerobic pacing tool determines pacing for five different levels of effort in practice: white (easy), pink (moderate), red (endurance), blue (threshold), purple (race pace). You can also import/export CSV files, so you can update time trial information and receive adjusted pacing. These workouts are inspired by Jon Urbanchek, Head Coach of the University of Michigan Swimming and Diving Team from 1982 to 2004.

In the Swim Workout Creator, you can enter a swim workout that includes sets containing the distance, a number of reps, description (free, kick, drill, etc) and time interval. The number of yardage and completion time will also be displayed. After creating the workout, you can download the workouts as a CSV, then import them later on, to view or edit the workouts
